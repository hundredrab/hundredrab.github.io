Who do I want to be? What path will I take?

## Aspiration

—Richard Feynman

- Get out of your own head (or, don't be Holden Caufield)
Be part of what's going on around you. Feast on it, adjust for it. There's no one to perform for. There is just work to be done and lessons to be learnt, in all that is around us.

For everything next, ego is the enemy, in success as much as in aspiration.

## Success

- Always stay a student.

> Every man I meet is my master in some point, and in that I learn of him. —Ralph Waldo Emerson

- **Scientia Infla.** Knowledge puffs up.
- Don't tell yourself a story. There was no plan, except in hindsight. The systems payed off, but you were never sure. We must shun the false crown and continue working on what got us here. Because that's the only thing that will keep us here.
- To know what you like is the beginning of wisdom and of old age. **Aatmanan Widdhi,** find out why you're after what you're after. Let them covet what you have, not the other way around. That's independence.
- Entitlement, control, and Paranoia: One of the symptoms of approaching a nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important. "The strongest poison ever known, came from Caesar's laurel crown." "He who indulges empty fears earns himself real fears" — Seneca
- Managing yourself responsibly requires increased clarity and purpose. First, setting the top-level goals and priorities of the organization and your life. Then enforcing and observing them to produce results and only results.

The disease of me can corrupt the most innocent climb. "Play for the name on the front of the jersey, and they'll remember the name on the back." **The credit? Who cares.**

> A monk is a man who is separated from all and who is in harmony with all.
 
- Meditate on the immensity.
Feel unprotected against the elements or forces or surroundings. Remind yourself how pointless it is to rage and fight and try to one-up those around you. Go and put yourself in touch with the infinite, and end your conscious separation from the world. Reconcile yourself a bit better with the realities of life. Realize how much came before you, and how only wisps of it remain.
Let the feeling carry you as long as you can. Then, when you start to feel better or bigger, go and do it again.
- Maintain your sobriety. Marcus: "Fight to be the person philosophy tried to make you. Most successful people are people you've never heard of. They want it that way. It keeps them sober. It helps them do their jobs.
Sobriety is the counterweight that must balance out the success.
- The Golden Meow: "In each case, it is hard work to find the intermediate; for instance, not everyone but only one who knows finds the midpoint in a circle.

> It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character.
 
- **Draw the line:** Killing what you love because you can't bear to part from it is selfish and stupid. If your reputation can't absorb a few blows, it wasn't worth anything in the first place.
- Maintain your own scorecard. Internal and external. Winning is not enough. People can get lucky and win. People can be assholes and win. Anyone can win. But not everyone is the best possible version of themselves.
- Always love and let go.

> Not to aspire or seek out of ego.
To have success without ego.
To push through failure with strength, not ego.
