## Core Philosophy

> Teach yourself to make thousands of those 1% improvements every day, and the benefits compound into a better you.

### Key Takeaways

- You are what you do, and your habits are a manifestation of your identity, but also help shape your identity
- Stack habits on top of each other until you can do all of it in autopilot, and then raise the bar some more
- Iterations and consistent improvement of these small habits, build up to large changes
- Do enough to matter, but first, make a habit to just show up
- You don't *have to* live your life. You *get to* enjoy it

## The Fundamentals

### Problems with Goals
- Habits only make a noticeable difference in the long run
- Goals are at odds with long-term process/growth (yo-yo effect)
- Goals restrict happiness

> You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

> The real habits don't just get you better results, but also change your beliefs about yourself.

### Identity-Based Habits
- **Identity → Process → Outcomes**
- Habits should be identity-based, not outcome-based
- Identity emerges out of habits. Each action is a **vote for the type of person** you are

### The Habit Loop
**Cue → Craving → Response → Reward**

### The Four Laws of Behavior Change

To build a good habit, make it:
- **Obvious → Attractive → Easy → Satisfying**

To break a bad habit, make it:
- **Invisible → Unattractive → Difficult → Unsatisfying**

## Law 1: Make It Obvious

- Most habits are triggered by cues unconsciously
- Build awareness through conscious observation

> Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate. —Carl Jung

### Strategies
- **"Pointing-and-calling"** (Japanese railway method) to build awareness
- **Habit scorecard**: Each habit votes for your identity, +ve or -ve. Always ask: "Is this what I want to become?"
- **Detailed planning**: when+where+what = better cues. Instead of "text XY every day", plan "text XY after dinner from the bedroom every night"
- **Habit stacking**: Stack habits on top of already built habits. "After this, do that"
- **Environment design**: Make cues visible everywhere in your environment
- Switching to a new habit is easier in a new environment (old environment has cues for old lifestyle)
- **Remove cues** of bad habits from environment (self-control is overrated)

## Law 2: Make It Attractive

### Temptation and Motivation
- Companies use *temptation bundling* to associate feel-good things with target habits
- **Habit burger**: Stack new habits with old habits before, and wants after
  - "I'll brush, then write for two hours, and then watch football for an hour"
- *Craving* and *anticipation* release more dopamine than the actual reward

### Social Influence
- People and environment are powerful motivators (e.g., Laszlo chess prodigies)
- We imitate *the close*, *the many*, and *the powerful*

### Reframing
- Recognize cravings as manifestations of basic needs—food, certainty, love, prestige
- **Replace "have to" with "get to"**
  - "It's time to build endurance and get fast."
  - "I'm excited for the presentation and the adrenaline is rushing to help me concentrate."
- Leverage already built associations (e.g., three deep breaths and smile when sad)

## Law 3: Make It Easy

### Motion vs Action
- Motion vs Action: Preparation can be a form of procrastination
- Don't get hung up on perfection. #JustDoIt

> Best is the enemy of good. —Voltaire

### Law of Least Effort
- Make it as easy as possible until you build the habit
- Good days are fine, but minimize friction for bad, unmotivated days
- **Pipe analogy**: Either crank up the pump or straighten the pipe (remove friction)

### Practical Strategies
- Fit habits into current life flow without going out of your way
- **Addition by subtraction**: Remove clutter to make it easy
- **Proactive laziness**: Prime environment for future use
- **Decisive moments**: Simple actions that shape much more

### The 2-Minute Rule
- Scale each starting habit down to just 2 minutes
- **Master showing up!**
- Make one-time purchases to lock future behavior

## Law 4: Make It Satisfying

### Immediate Feedback
- Ancient brain: immediately rewarded = repeated; immediately punished = avoided
- **Habit tracking** provides visual feedback
  - The Jar of Pins method
  - Don't break the chain

### Measurement vs Goals
- Measures are indicators, not goals

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. —Goodhart's Law

### Accountability
- Habit contracts and accountability partners help
- We attach high importance to what people think of us

## Advanced Tactics

### Genetics and Strengths
- Genes predispose, not predetermine
- They tell us **what** to work hard on
- Find and play to your strengths
- **Explore/exploit trade-off**: When you can't exploit, *explore*

### Finding Your Strengths
- What makes me lose track of time?
- Where do I get greater returns than average?
- What comes naturally to me?
- Can't find a field? Create one (like Scott Adams with Dilbert)

> Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg.

### The Goldilocks Rule
- Stay just at the edge of peak performance to keep improving and avoid boredom

> At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, lifting the same weights over and over.

### Professional vs Amateur Mindset
- Professionals stick to schedule; amateurs let life get in the way
- Avoid being "fair-weather" at anything

### Continuous Improvement
- Creating habits has downsides: easier to let mistakes slide when "good enough"
- Instead: let each habit unlock the next level of performance

> Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery

### Reflection and Review
- Reflect & Review medium-term (quarterly/yearly):
  - What went well?
  - What didn't go well?
  - What did I learn?
- Allow yourself to **revisit your identity**

> A lack of self-awareness is poison; reflection and review is the antidote.

- Keep your identity small (don't let circumstances like job changes affect core identity)
- **Always look for the next way to get 1 percent better**
